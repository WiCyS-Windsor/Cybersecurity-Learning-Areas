Cyber Security Areas
Data Loss Prevention:
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a process used to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, and access by unauthorized users. Many organisations used standard processes and tools to avoid such data loss breaches. DLP software classifies regulated, confidential, and business critical data and identifies violation of policies within the organization. Once those violations are identified, DLP enforces remediation with alerts, encryption, and other protective actions to prevent end users from accidentally or maliciously sharing data that could put the organization at risk. Data loss prevention solves three main objectives that are common pain points for many organizations: personal information protection / compliance, intellectual property (IP) protection, and data visibility. McAfee is most widely used DLP software worldwide.

Penetration Testing: 
A penetration test is an authorized simulated cyber attack against the computer system to uncover vulnerabilities in application system, API’s, frontend/backend servers. It is commonly used to augment a web application firewall. It is performed to identify weaknesses including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system’s data and features. Penetration test reports may also assess potential impacts to the organization and suggest countermeasures to reduce the risk. The penetration testing process is divided into five stages such as, Planning and reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining access, Maintaining access, Analysis & WAF (web application firewall) configuration.

Secure DevOps:
DevOps enables integration of software development and IT operations together to increase operational efficiency and deliverability. During the process there are high chances of risks and cultural changes associated with it which can affect the entire pipeline and create new security challenges such as Privileged Access Management, Insecure code practices. Secure software practices focus on providing reliable software with reduced attacked surface. Such process can help the developer to worry less about being hacked and more focus on preventing attacks and quickly recovering from cyber incidents during the CI/CD integration.



Secure Software Development:
Secure Software Development is a process of developing software practices by ensuring security is built in the software. Security is most effective when planned and managed throughout the stages of software development lifecycle (SDLC). Integration of security in SDLC ensures sensitive and critical data is handled without loss of data. Applications, systems, and networks are constantly under various security attacks such as malicious code or denial of service. Some of the challenges from the application development security point of view include Viruses, Trojan horses, Logic bombs, Worms, Agents, and Applets[]. The core activities essential to the software development process to produce secure applications and systems include conceptual definition, functional requirements, control specification, design review, code review and walk-through, system test review, and maintenance and change management []. Development of secure software is a responsibility of all the stakeholders which includes management, project managers, business analysts, quality assurance managers, technical architects, security specialists, application owners, developers, and testers.

Identity and Access Management:
Identity and Access Management is a framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the proper people in an enterprise have the appropriate access to technology resources [1]. With an IAM framework in place, information technology (IT) managers can control user access to critical information within their organizations [2]. IAM falls under IT security and data management. IdM/ IAM covers issues such as how users gain an identity, the roles and, sometimes, the permissions that identity grants, the protection of that identity and the technologies supporting that protection (e.g., network protocols, digital certificates, passwords, etc.) [1]. IAM ensures authentication of user to access the sensitive data and performed actions they are authorized to access and modify. Systems used for IAM include single sign-on systems, two-factor authentication, multifactor authentication and privileged access management. These technologies also provide the ability to securely store identity and profile data as well as data governance functions to ensure that only data that is necessary and relevant is shared [2].

Governance, Risk and Compliance:
GRC is an integrated, holistic approach to organization-wide governance, risk and compliance ensuring that an organization acts ethically correct and in accordance with its risk appetite, internal policies, and external regulations, through the alignment of strategy, processes, technology, and people, thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness [1]. Successful implementations of single integrated GRC software packages enable organizations to manage risk, reduce costs incurred by multiple installations and minimize complexity for managers [2]. In GRC, governance is needed for setting directions, monitoring performance, and control, and evaluating outcomes. Risk management ensures that the organization identifies, analyses, and controls risk that can derail the achievement of strategic objectives. Compliance ensures that depending on the context, the organization takes measures and implements controls to assure that compliance requirements are met consistently [3]. Many organizations worldwide have adopted GRC software to implement and manage enterprise GRC programs.

Incident Response and Forensic Analysis:
In the enterprise, digital investigations are often associated with incident response – the detection and investigation of system compromises and targeted attacks.  A distributed forensic investigation platform serves to increase digital readiness by lowering the investigative cost and increasing the quality of digital evidence obtainable [1]. Organizations worldwide are following automated live response mechanism instead of using traditional approach where live response are used as a critical part of the investigative process to capture and document volatile system state prior to hard disk imaging. Triaging is another mechanism used to reduce the time required to image the systems. Many enterprise management tools give the investigator complete access to the underlying filesystem and memory. It can seriously pose threat to the personal identifiable information. Therefore, with tighter regulations regarding the privacy, companies conduct routine investigation tasks such as malware infection which must be delegated quickly to a large number of operators while sensitive investigations which might require access to private information must be legally managed within a small number of operators.

Big Data & Application security:
Big data are being used in various cybersecurity applications. For example, in Security information and Event Management systems (SIEM), nonrelational database (NoSQL) are used to store logs, messages and security events. The practical significance of Big Data technologies lies in the ability to detect primary and secondary signs of preparation and conduct of computer attacks, the detection of abnormal behavior of controlled objects and subjects, the classification of previously unknown mass and group cyber attacks (including new DDOS and APT), the detection of the traces of computer traces crimes, etc., that is, in all cases when the use of traditional means of information protection (SIEM, IDS / IPS, system of protection from unauthorized access to information, cryptographic information protection facility, antiviruses, etc.) is not very effective [1] . Cybercrime and attacks can cause devastating financial losses and affect organizations and individuals as well. It is estimated that, a data breach costs 8.19 million USD for the United States and 3.9 million USD on an average, and the annual cost to the global economy from cybercrime is 400 billion USD [2]. The ultimate goal of cybersecurity data science is data-driven intelligent decision making from security data for smart cybersecurity solutions [2].
